## Developer first

Don't be product or client oriented, just do the correct thing. As
[Warren Buffet](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett) said, "if you want
to proffit, contract the best and let them do what they do the best, or contract
the cheapest ones and make them do what you dictate". A developer relaxed,
motivated, with a purposse, recognized by its work and feeling realized will
lead to increase project quality, that in the long term will lead to shorter
schedules and happier clients.

## Important things first

"Don't let urgent tasks don't let you do the important ones". Keep one day a
week to do code clean-up, refactoring and maintenance tasks, and plan your
schudle toward it. Fridays seems a good weekday, since people is usually already
thinking on the weekend instead of work and productivity levels are lower after
a full working week, so a "mind context switch" on their main tasks to do some
other lower priority ones like improving documentation or test coverage, fixing
code hacks and pending TODOs, contribute to some Open Source project used by the
company, or experiment and learn with some new technologies will lead them to do
some short-timed low-skills tasks that will keep them productive and motivated
without demanding too much attention and also being more focused during these
last working week hours, and take a fresh breath to don't bring job problems to
home during the weekend. These hours could also be used to work on side projects
that could bring some proffitability to the company in the future by openning
oportunities in new development areas, too.
